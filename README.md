# FarmGuard AI - Intelligent Plant Pathology & Advisory System

![Interface](https://github.com/LUwUcifer/Agri_Disease/blob/main/Interface.jpg)

## Overview

FarmGuard AI is a crop disease and pest attack, prediction and warning application designed to help farmers protect and improve their harvest by giving alerts and suggestions. The app uses weather APIs to fetch for temperature, rain, humidity, season and other data according to the region. Then pre-trained CNN will predict the disease as per the crop type and its growth stage.

## Features

1. Prediction on weather data - One way to estimate the disease is to enter details of crop and region in the application.
2. Prediction on plant image - Other way is upload a image on the application and CNN will estimate the disease afer using Histogram Equalization and CLAHE Enhancement on image for better accuracy.
3. Alerts from Government on app - AI will consider online news to get updates.
4. Offline Alerts via SMS - Alerts and warnings will be given through FarmGuard-AI app and SMS.
5. Local Scanning Device - A small device that will work similar to the app, with built-in memory and GPS system to provide offline data through image scanning.
6. Regular Updation - Database will be updated based on feebacks about disease information, and prediction system.
7. User-Friendly Interface - App could be translated to local languages for ease to farmers.

## How It Works

#### Farmers enter details about crop type, crop growth stage and their location.

#### App will fetch weather details and shows most probable disease, provide alerts and suggestions accordingly.

#### Local Scanning Device will the the plant image and works in the same way as mobile app.
